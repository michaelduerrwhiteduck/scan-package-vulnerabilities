# scan-package-vulnerabilities


Scan Node.js project dependencies for known vulnerabilities, aggregating all occurrences of each package (by simplified name) and their version information.

## Overview

`scan-package-vulnerabilities` is a Node.js tool that analyzes a project's `package-lock.json` file to identify and report vulnerabilities in its dependencies. It collects all occurrences of each package (regardless of path), aggregates them under the simplified package name (without any path information), and lists all found versions and their full package paths. The vulnerability scan then checks for affected version numbers in the aggregated lists for each package name and generates a detailed report.

## Features

- Reads and parses `package-lock.json` from a Node.js project
- Aggregates all occurrences of each package (by simplified name) and their version information, including full package paths
- Checks all found versions for each package name against a list of known vulnerabilities
- Generates a report for each vulnerable package and a summary vulnerability report

## Usage

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. Place the `analyse-packages.js` script in your Node.js project directory (or ensure it can access your `package-lock.json`).
3. Run the script using Node.js, providing the path to your `package-lock.json` file as a required command-line argument:

	```sh
	node analyse-packages.js <path-to-package-lock.json>
	```

	For example, if your `package-lock.json` is in the current directory:

	```sh
	node analyse-packages.js package-lock.json
	```

	The script requires this parameter to locate and analyze your project's dependencies.

4. The script will output a list of all packages (grouped by simplified name) with their found versions and full package paths, followed by a vulnerability report based on the provided vulnerabilities list.
